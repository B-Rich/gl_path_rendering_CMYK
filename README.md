# gl_path_rendering_CMYK

This sample shows how to use NVIDIA path rendering extension.

It also exposes it through FBO (Frame-buffer-objects) and shows how to work on CMYK-Alpha format.

__Note__: to make this sample work, cmake will require some tools to be accessible. We know how painfull it can be to
find them back. So we packaged a zip file containing all needed.
Download it from https://developer.nvidia.com/samples (Note: work in progress... need to upload the package in few days!)
and unzip it at the same location where you downloaded the samples (separate repositories). ou should then have a folder named '//shared_external//'. cmake setup will be able to locate it.
